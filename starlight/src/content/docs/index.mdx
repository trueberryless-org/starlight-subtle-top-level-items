## How to use this site

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Above sidebar" icon="information">
    Above the sidebar you can see different **hashes**. Click on them to see different styles applied to the sidebar items.
  </Card>
  <Card title="View styling" icon="open-book">
    When you click on one of the "topics", you will see the styling applied to the sidebar items by default, switch between some demonstration pages to get a better idea.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Suggest new style" icon="pencil">
    If you have an idea for a new style, you currently don't see as an option (topic), write a description of it (or even better the styles to apply) in [this discussion](https://github.com/withastro/starlight/discussions/2908), so I can add it soon.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Why hashes?" icon="star">
    The IDs for the topics are the stylings hashed with SHA-256, so it is easy to reference them in [the discussion](https://github.com/withastro/starlight/discussions/2908).
  </Card>
</CardGrid>
